Mayby not show math until after, during result at end of turn?
Mayby an internal wiki. With the combo's that have been tried.


Stations should both be workable or let the person asigned be workable. 
So multiple people can work on one task or multiple people can work on seperate identical tasks. Per slot per workstation.
Need a way to tell if station is the taskholder or the person is the taskholder.
